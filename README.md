# Student Records Processing (C)

Compact C program that loads student records from a file, validates them, and enables instant lookups by ID using binary search. Designed to showcase strong fundamentals in C: safe file I/O, structs and arrays, algorithmic thinking, and clear error handling. Example: given a file of students with strictly increasing IDs, the program reads their info, checks ordering, and lets the user search efficiently. Demonstrates clean code, practical problem solving, and attention to detail.
