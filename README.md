## ðŸ”¹ Overview
The program reads a file containing student records, validates the data, stores it in memory, and allows efficient lookup by student ID.

### Key Skills Demonstrated
- **File I/O** in C (reading structured data safely).
- **Data validation** (ensuring records are sorted by ID).
- **Structs and arrays** for clean data organization.
- **Binary search** for efficient record lookup.
- **Error handling** and robust input checking.
